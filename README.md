Android Oracle Connectivity

Here I have created a demo for Android Oracle Connectivity.

- You have to change your IP Address with Database name in [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/pratikbutani/Android-Oracle-Connection/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/absingh/query/MainActivity.java#L38)
- You can setup username password of database in [Config File](https://github.com/pratikbutani/Android-Oracle-Connection/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/config.properties)
